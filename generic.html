								<h3 style="text-align: center;">What We Do</h3>
								<hr />
								<p style="text-align: center;">Since opening our doors in 2024, we've been dedicated to providing reliable, high-quality caulking services for residential clients. Timber Tight prides itself on precision workmanship, durable results, and a commitment to customer satisifaction. Whether its sealing, waterproofing, or restoration, we deliver solutions that protect your property and stand the test of time.</p>

								<p style="text-align: center;">Investing in new caulking applications offers numerous benefits for any property. Fresh, professionally applied caulking helps prevent drafts, water intrusion, and moisture damage - one of the leading causes of structural deterioration and mold growth. It also improves energy efficiency by sealing gaps and joints, reducing heating and cooling loss throughout the year. Beyond protection, new caulking enhances the overall appearance of a building by creating clean, seamless lines around windows, doors, siding, and interior finishes. With modern materials designed for long-lasting flexibility and durability, a new application provides peace of mind and lasting value for your home or business.</p>
